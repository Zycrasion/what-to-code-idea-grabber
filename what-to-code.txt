Title: Snake
	Description: If you had a cellphone in the early 2000s, you’ve probably played Snake. It’s a simple game but you can always try to make things more complex! First, start by just trying to make the game.

Title: A simple HTTP Server
	Description: During our web development journey, all of us would have used a web server in one way or the other (MAMP, Apache, Node Server etc). But you would get a better understand of how the server works if you implement one on your own. Learn socket programming and try to give it a shot and see if you can serve web pages

Title: Maze Generator
	Description: This project is a versatile introductory exercise in goal-setting and problem solving. It’s also open-ended enough that there are lots of ways to go about it. Find a way to randomly generate a maze, and then create an algorithm that will navigate through the maze and successfully reach the maze’s exit. A popular method to accomplish both is the genetic algorithm, a not-quite-brute-force way of training your program to solve problems (which means you’re making AI!). Bob Nystrom has a particularly great guide on generating mazes and dungeons.

Title: Virtual Pet Simulator
	Description: For those who are missing the cute factor in their work, a virtual pet simulator is a fun standard project. First pick a type of creature like an animal or some type of monster to design, but beginners can start with a basic circle to represent the pet. Once you’ve chosen your concept, give your pet a name, age, and other properties like health and happiness. You might also want to keep in mind physics concepts like movement, gravity, and inertia. Depending on your experience and whether you’re opting for a 2D or 3D model, your pet and its background can come many different ways. You can also customize features on your pet, like programming specific responses to stimuli. This is a great project because you can continuously revisit and improve as you develop your skills.

Title: Conway's GameOfLife
	Description:  It is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. You just have to observe how it evolves.
How it works :
        Every cell, which are placed on a grid, interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
    - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
    - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The system for the creation of money can be as simple as a daily allowance, or some other thing you can come up with yourself!

Title: A JSON encoder/decoder

Many programming languages have a library for serializing its native data structures to JSON and back, but rolling your own can be an interesting exercise.

Title: Invoice and contract management system
	Description: Contract and invoice management are very complex processes. Contracts can have a lot of nuanced clauses and stipulations that can be difficult to track.
This makes this a very good project, even if you simplify it to some of its core components. Having to translate a complex business process into software is not easy. But it is what makes this project a good challenge.
Again, we wouldn’t overcomplicate this. Take a basic feature, like inputting the terms of a contract, and develop this part first. Then you can add other features like invoice tracking, contract analytics and forecasting.

Start out by trying to create the ability to create a job posting first. Then you can go and focus on the job searchers and how they respond.

Title: Secure foler
	Description: Create a program that will generate a secure folder for your data. Alongside that, the program will generate two additional files: 'lock' & 'unlock'. When launched 'lock', the application silently runs and encrypts every file which is placed in that specific folder. In order to unlock files, the user will have to run 'unlock' file, which will ask for a password and when entered it should send the password to another silent application to check if it is correct. If it is - files will be unlocked and if not, the application will silently shutdown.

The catch: This application should initialize a small local webserver, to which you should connect. You'll have to set up things there, such as password and amount of incorrect tries along with what will be done if that's the case.
